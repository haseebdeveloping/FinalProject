# Restaurant Management System

### Team 
- Ali Shazal
- Aiza Usman
- Haseebullah Khan

### Requirements Gathering
The requirements were gathered in the following way:
- we interviewed 2 successful restaurant chains that already use a restaurant management system on what they like about their system. Seeing that we are yound student developrs, they were generous enough to give us a tour of their system. We noted the key features. Later, we talked to the managers individually to know what they liked about the system, what they disliked, anything that can be improved, and any inefficiencies in the system.
- we also utilized the Joint Application Development (JAD) methodology to carve out the requirements with Pancake Factory, the company that will be using our system. Majority of our requirements come from this session.

### Software Development Model

We will utilize agile development and specifically the Scrum framework for our project. This is because of the following reasons:
- The restaurant management system is a new solution that we're creating. We have never worked on such a solution before. Our previous work has been is database systems and inventory management systems.
- The stakeholders have conveyed to us that since this is a new product for them too, the requirements will change as we move further in the process. This is one of the most influential factors for our decision to go with the Scrum framework.
- While two members of the team know Javascript as a language, tools that we will utilize in the project such as Node.JS and Firebase are new to the team.
- We have three dedicated members that will work on this project and they are all located in Abu Dhabi.
- Our customer, Pancake Factory, is heavily involved in the process for feedback and guidance. Since they are moving away from their manual and paper-based system, they are very excited for this project.
